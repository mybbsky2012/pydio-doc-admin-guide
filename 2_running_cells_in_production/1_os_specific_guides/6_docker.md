_This guide describes the steps required to have the Pydio Cells Docker container running._

### How to use the Pydio Cells docker image

The [Pydio cells image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pydio/cells/) is designed to be used in a micro-service environment. It only contains what is strictly necessary to run the Pydio Cells binary and nothing more.

In order to have a fully working Pydio Cells environment, you need to run a database (MySQL or MariaDB) on the same network. A basic setup is described on this page.

#### Run the container

```sh
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 pydio/cells
```

You can now access the Pydio Cells installer at [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080). A complete example can be found in the docker-compose section of this guide.

If you want to access your container from outside you must then change atleast the `CELLS_EXTERNAL` and also (it's recommended) to have persisting data you need to have a volume (you can sort it with multiple volumes if you wish, but for our example we are going to store everyting into a single folder).

Here's an example of a command that runs a cells container with persistent data and external access:

```sh
docker run -d -e CELLS_EXTERNAL=192.168.0.172:8080 -e CELLS_BIND=192.168.0.172:8080 -p 8080:8080 -v /home/cells/volume/:/root/.config/pydio/ pydio/cells
```

* **-e** *CELLS_EXTERNAL* is required to give it external access
* **-e** *CELLS_BIND* can be, the server running the container address or localhost.
* **-v** */home/cells/volume/:/root/.config/pydio/* basically i have a folder on my server located here `/home/cells/volume/` and i want the content to be the all of the cells configuration/datasource that are located inside the container in `root/.config/pydio/`.

_This was only an example on how you can run a Cells container, you can find below all of the envorinment variables, data configurations for cells, docker-compose examples and more_


#### External database

Pydio Cells requires a MySQL or MariaDB database. It is recommended to use a separate database and a dedicated user with access to that database. A complete example can be found in the docker-compose section of this guide.

_Be advised if you pull the latest mysql image it will be MySQL 8 which has a new authentication method and which is for the moment not compatible (it's on our roadmap)_.
_We recommand that you pull MySQL version 5.7 for the time being_

#### Persistent data

All default configuration and data (`/root/.config` on the container) is saved in an unnamed volume.

If you want to use named volumes, here is an overview of the important files :

- `/root/.config/pydio/cells/pydio.json` : main configuration file
- `/root/.config/pydio/cells/data` : data
- `/root/.config/pydio/cells/logs` : logs
- `/root/.config/pydio/cells/services` : services information
- `/root/.config/pydio/cells/static` : static frontend files

Note: If you [add new datasources](https://pydio.com/fr/docs/cells/v1/managing-datasources) and want to persist the data, ensure that their location is also mounted in a volume.

#### Environment variable

- `CELLS_NO_SSL`: uses ssl or not (default to 0 => uses ssl)
- `CELLS_BIND` : address where the application http server is bound to. It MUST contain a server name and a port.
- `CELLS_EXTERNAL` : url the end user will use to connect to the application.

**If you wish to use the 0.0.0.0 address you must respect this rule, cells_bind must have this form `cells_bind=0.0.0.0:<port>` and `cells_external=<domain name,address>:<port>` the port is mandatory in both otherwise you will have a grey screen stuck in the loading**

Example:
If you want your application to run on the localhost at port 8080 and use the url mycells.mypydio.com, then set CELLS_BIND to localhost:8080 and CELLS_EXTERNAL to mycells.mypydio.com

### Example setup with docker compose

```yaml
version: '3'
services:

    # Cells image with two named volumes for the static and for the data
    cells:
        image: pydio/cells:latest
        restart: always
        volumes: ["static:/root/.config/pydio/cells/static/pydio", "data:/root/.config/pydio/cells/data"]
        ports: ["8080:8080"]
        environment:
            - CELLS_BIND=localhost:8080
            - CELLS_EXTERNAL=localhost:8080
            - CELLS_NO_SSL=1

    # MySQL image with a default database cells and a dedicated user pydio
    mysql:
         image: mysql:5.7
         restart: always
         environment:
             MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: P@ssw0rd
             MYSQL_DATABASE: cells
             MYSQL_USER: pydio
             MYSQL_PASSWORD: P@ssw0rd
         command: [mysqld, --character-set-server=utf8mb4, --collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci]
         ports: ["3306:3306"]

volumes:
    static: {}
    data: {}
```

### Public access

#### HTTPS

We recommend you [run behind a proxy](https://pydio.com/en/docs/kb/devops) to encrypt the content you want to publish over the internet.

The [nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy) and [docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion](https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion) containers can also be used to setup your proxy.

### Troubleshooting 

#### Check that after a server or container reboot that the address is the same

If you ever restart your server and or your containers docker might attribute you another address for your containers.

For instance docker usually has containers addresses looking like this `172.17.0.5` and therefore in Cells the default datasources or the ones that you will be creating on the filesystem will all be using this peer address by default.

You might stumble upon this issue, if that's the case you need to access the `pydio.json` file and change the old occurrences of the address with the newest one.

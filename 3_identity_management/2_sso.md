Single Sign On (SSO) is the most important part of a cloud-oriented application. By splitting the authentication from the logic of application and linking to a dedicated third-party service for identification, users can use unique credentials to access to many applications, without these application ever knowing about these credentials.  

Cells has the ability to work as an Identity Provider for third party. Additionally, Cells Enterprise has the ability to work as both as an Identity Provider and a Service Provider consuming authentication from third-party services using the *OIDC* and *SAML2.0* protocols. Furthermore, Cells Enterprise provides a simple way to connect one or many external LDAP or Active Directory servers.

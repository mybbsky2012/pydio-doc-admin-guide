_In terms of requirements, Cells Enterprise Edition has the exact same technical requirements as Cells Home edition (see previous [page](/en/docs/cells/v1/requirements)). It justs requires an additional license file as exposed below._

### Obtaining an enterprise license

Currently, the Enterprise License cannot be provisioned automatically from the website. Please contact our Sales services, they will be happy to send you a limited-time license key for testing. If you are an existing customer and your license is about to expire, use our dedicated support directly from your Pydio.com dashboard.

Licenses are based on a per-user model and an expiration time. Users count is based on users that have an actual access to the application (accesses to one or more workspaces).

### Installing the license

If installing using Cells browser-based installer, you can copy/paste the license key directly in the installation form. However, if you want to install Cells using the command-line tool, you first have to manually copy the license key inside a file named pydio-license at the following location:

**For linux**: `~/.config/pydio/cells/pydio-license`

**For MacOS** : `~/Library/Application Support/pydio/cells/pydio-license`

### License Status

After installation, the "Enterprise License" menu in the Settings panel displays the status of your current license, showing expiration time and number of users used.
